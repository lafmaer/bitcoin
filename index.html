                Bitcoin was the original cryptocurrency, it was introduced roughly ten years ago.
                While it was the first cryptocurrency, it wasn't the first attempt at one. Because cryptocurrency is
                such a revolutionary technology, it was inevitable that
                many people were going to attempt to generate their own cryptocurrencies.
              </p>
              <p class="description__text">
                In early 2009, the first Bitcoin block (called the Genesis Block) was mined by Satoshi
                Nakamoto, whose true name is still unknown. In May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz ordered two pizzas, and that
                was the first time that Bitcoin was
                used to buy actual goods. To this day, pizza is one of the main goods which can be bought using
                cryptocurrency.
              </p>
              <p class="description__text">
                2010 was the year when cryptocurrencies started to appear, and by 2013, already nearly a
                dozen different cryptocurrencies in existence.

              <p class="description__text">
                Since 2013, other cryptocurrencies have filled the digital assets market. The world of
                cryptocurrency expands and expands. Cryptocurrency gains popularity, and it is progressively being
                accepted by more and more networks, brands
                and shops.

                Cryptocurrency's popularity is growing, along with its value and its very high potential for
                profit. This, combined with other benefits like being the only party having control of your assets
                (while a bank may be a third party
                currently with control in your assets), lead to two important developments:

              reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration of personal data. Some of
              the safeguards we use are firewalls and very strict data encryption which include: 3 level of encryptions,
